    <h1> Hi, I am Elizabeth Wittingslow also known as Bess.
    </h1>
    <p> Over the past year I have done a lot of reflecting on my life, thinking about all the difficult paths and or mistakes I have made and how now I try to learn from these to ensure positive outcomes are in place to move forward. I have been setting goals that I never thought possible.</p>

  <p>I have finally realised my purpose in life is to bring joy and happiness to beautiful souls needing inspiration from this very crazy world.</p>

  <p>Tell me who is struggling to find purpose or that light that sets your soul on fire? </p>

  <p>Start by reflecting inwards and believing in your self</p>

<p>“Our job in this lifetime is not to shape ourselves into some ideal we imagine we ought to be, but to find out who we already are and become it.”
</p>
